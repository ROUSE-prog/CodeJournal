<h2>Intro into Differential Calculus</h2>
    <p>Calculus is essential for a data scientist because it provides a foundation for mathematical optimization,
         a field used to tune machine learning models to classify and make predictions.
         With that in mind, let’s dive in.</p>

<h2>Important Concepts </h2>
    <p>A limit is the value of a function approaches as we move to some x value.
    The limit definition of a derivative shows us how to measure the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a specific point.
    A derivative is the slope of a tangent line at a specific point. The derivative of a function f(x) is denoted as f’(x).
    The derivative of a function allows us to determine when a function is increasing, decreasing, or is at a minimum or maximum value.</p>
    <p>Derivative Rules
    We learned the following general derivative rules:
    \begin{aligned} \frac{d}{dx} c f(x) = c f'(x) \\ \frac{d}{dx}(f(x) + g(x)) = \frac{d}{dx}f(x) + \frac{d}{dx}g(x) \\ \frac{d}{dx}c = 0 \\ f(x) = u(x)v(x) \rightarrow f'(x) =u(x)v'(x) + v(x)u'(x) \end{aligned}

     (x)=u(x)v

     (x)
    We also learned how to calculate derivatives for explicit functions:
    \begin{aligned} \frac{d}{dx}x^{n} = nx^{n-1} \frac{d}{dx}ln(x) = \frac{1}{x} \\ \frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x \\ \frac{d}{dx}sin(x) = cos(x) \\ \frac{d}{dx}cos(x) = -sin(x) \end{aligned}

    Derivatives in Python
    np.gradient() allows us to calculate derivatives of functions represented by arrays.</p>
